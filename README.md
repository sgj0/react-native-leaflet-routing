# react-native-leaflet-routing
A React Native component using WebView to provide a Leaflet Routing.

## Overview
This package is based on :

- [reggie3/react-native-webview-leaflet](https://github.com/reggie3/react-native-webview-leaflet)

For the map :

- [Leaflet/Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)
- [PaulLeCam/react-leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet)

For the routing :

- [perliedman/leaflet-routing-machine](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-routing-machine)

These packages have each a complete documentation that I recommend to read if you want to edit this component.

## Install
```bash
npm install --save react-native-leaflet-routing
```

  from={[latitude, longitude]}

  // required: coordinates of the arriving point
  to={[latitude, longitude]}
